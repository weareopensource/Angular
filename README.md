## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814)

## Installation
It's straightforward
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/weareopensource/Angular.git
$ npm i
```

## Running Your Application
   ### Development
   * Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
   ### Production
   * Run `npm run build:prod` to build your client App
   This process takes into account all system environment variables defined under the form FRONT_PATH_TO_VARIABLE. Basicly, it turns those system environment variables into an object, infering the path from the string, and merges it to the environment object defined on environment.prod.ts to regenerate that file. 

<!--
## Running unit tests
Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Developper Guide
In order to develop some feature modules with respect of the starter structure, for instance, if you wand to add an entry point to the sidenav, you should provide a configuration object to the core-state module that manages the content of sidenav. Your configuration file consists of an object with an entry called `core` witch have the following structure
```
export const myFeatureConfiguration: FeatureConfiguration = {
  ... // myFeature can provide a configuration for different modules
  core: {  // coreModule configuration
    sidenav: [{
      order: number;
      link: string, // ie the URL path to access the module
      name: string,  // ie the name appears on the sidenav
      icon: string; // ie the svg material icon that correspond to your feature. It follows the rule: set:ic___<icon_name>____24px
    }]
  }
  ...
};
```

Your feature can provide multiple entries to the sidenav since the `menuItems` entry is an array.
Once defined, you have to pass the configuration to the core-state module (ie the core module part that manages the datas or state) when it's initilizing.
<br>
app.module.ts:
```
  ...
  CoreStateModule.forRoot([..., myFeatureConfiguration.core]),
  ...
```

In order to modify the logo and the title, directy edit the `self` entry of the coreConfiguration object.
<br>
core.configuration.ts:
```
export const coreConfiguration: CoreConfiguration = {
  self: {
    ...
    logo: '/assets/rominet-logo.svg',
    title: 'Angular starter',
    ...
  }
};
```
